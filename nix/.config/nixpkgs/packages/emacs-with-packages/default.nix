# TODO:
# Figure out how to include packages that aren't in nixpkgs.  I think there is
# still a use case for having submodules in ~/.emacs.d (for stuff that I want to
# contribute to) but for others that just aren't available on melpa yet I would
# like to have them here (for example, flow-js2-mode).
